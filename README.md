This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline to predict medical insurance charges.

## Structure
- `data/`: Place your `insurance.csv` dataset here.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the main Jupyter notebook for exploration and training.
- `models/`: Stores trained pipelines/models (`.joblib` files).
- `src/`: Deployment scripts (Flask/Streamlit apps).

## Getting Started
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run `notebooks/insurance_prediction.ipynb`
3. Save models into `models/` and run deployment scripts in `src/`.
